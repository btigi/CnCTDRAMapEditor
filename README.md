# Mobius Map Editor

## Fork Summary
This repository contains a fork Nyerguds' [Mobius Map Editor repository](https://github.com/Nyerguds/MobiusMapEditor). This fork contains a single change; the ability to create non-standard sized maps. The size of a new map can be configured by editing MapMaxX, MapMaxY, MapMaxXMega and MapMaxXY in CnCTDRAMapEditorD.exe.config.

**Maps of a non-standard size will not be playable, and will likely crash all versions of the game and all other map editors.**

## Project

Mobius Map Editor is an enhanced version of the map editor supplied with the Command & Conquer Remastered Collection, based on [the source code released by Electronic Arts](https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Remastered_Collection/).

The editor can edit maps for Command & Conquer Tiberian Dawn, Sole Survivor and Red Alert. The goal of the project is to improve the usability and convenience of the map editor, fix bugs, improve and clean its code-base, enhance compatibility with different kinds of systems and enhance the editor's support for mods.

As of v1.5.0.0, the editor no longer requires the C&C Remaster; if the C&C Remastered Collection is not installed on the PC, you can launch the editor in Classic mode instead, using the original 90's graphics.

Updates are regularly posted on my little corner of [the C&C Mod Haven Discord server](https://discord.gg/fGbEYfxqkZ).

### Contributing

Right now, I'm not really looking into making this a joint project. Specific bug reports and suggestions are always welcome though, but post them as issues.

## Download

Github can be a bit tricky to nagivate, but you can find the latest releases in the right-hand sidebar, under **Releases**. Once there, scroll past the changes list, and download the first .zip file in the list. [Click here](https://github.com/Nyerguds/MobiusMapEditor/releases/latest/) to go straight to the latest release.

## Installation

**DO NOT unpack this in the C&C Remastered Collection's install folder.** It is absolutely unnecessary to overwrite any files of the installed game.

Simply unpack the editor into a new folder on your disk somewhere. On first startup, it will automatically try to detect the folder in which the game is installed, and if it can't find it, it will show a popup asking you to locate it. Note that this autodetect only works on Steam installations of the game.

It is advised to install the `GraphicsFixesTD` and `GraphicsFixesRA` mods, to fix errors and add missing bits in the Remastered graphics. The editor will use the mods automatically when they are installed, even if they are not enabled inside the game. You can find them on the Steam workshop ([GraphicsFixesTD](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844969675), [GraphicsFixesRA](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2978875641)) and on ModDB ([GraphicsFixesTD](https://www.moddb.com/games/command-conquer-remastered/addons/graphicsfixestd), [GraphicsFixesRA](https://www.moddb.com/games/cc-red-alert-remastered/addons/graphicsfixesra)).

## Features

A brief overview of the improvements and added features:

* Can be configured to run independently from the C&C Remastered Collection, using classic graphics.
* Can open files straight from the games' .mix archives.
* Improved problem detection in map loading, which will always give a full list of the found issues, rather than refusing to open the map.
* Keyboard shortcuts for most functions in the editor.
* Drag & drop support for opening missions.
* Flood fill function for map tiles, to easily fill large areas in water-based and Interior maps.
* Multithreading for loading and saving, preventing the application from freezing during these operations.
* Image export function, with adjustable scale, and choice of shown object types.
* An ini rules section in the map settings. The editor will automatically adapt to rule changes conerning power use, bibs and capturability.
* Sole Survivor and Tiberian Dawn megamap support.
* Missing objects added: unused decorations and pavements in Overlay and Smudge, and farmer fields and haystacks in Buildings.
* Mod loading support to allow applying graphics fixes, and filling in graphics for objects that were not remastered.
* The ability to enable/disable the added units of Red Alert's Aftermath expansion pack in missions.
* Vastly improved triggers and teamtypes editors, with clear descriptions and tooltips for all options, and a trigger analysis function to detect possible issues.
* Map objects overview, including analysis of unused scripting objects (triggers, globals, teams, waypoints).
* Power balance and silo level tools, which account for rule tweaks and for buildings scripted to be built later.
* Tile randomisation in Red Alert interior maps, allowing the use of previously unused alternate graphics that exist for almost all tiles.
* Options in the editor's .config file can tweak specific editor behaviour, like allowing overlapping bibs or theater-illegal objects.

* Ability to create non-standard sized maps (edit the MaxMapX and MaxMapY settings values in CnCTDRAMapEditorD.exe.config).

The full change log can be viewed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

### Possible future features

Some ideas that might get implemented in the future:

* A function to automatically add ant rules.
* The ability to change a map's theater.
* A copy & paste function.
* Support for Attack Tarcom orders.
* A filter on waypoints in the Teamtypes
